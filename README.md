# Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data ðŸ“ˆðŸš¨  

This repository contains a Python-based project for detecting anomalies in time series data, a crucial task in applications such as financial fraud detection, system monitoring, and predictive maintenance. The project leverages popular data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning libraries, ensuring efficient and accurate detection.  

## Key Features  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Utilizes **Pandas** for data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory analysis.  
   - Implements missing value imputation and time-series formatting.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Provides insightful visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to identify trends, seasonality, and outliers.  

3. **Anomaly Detection Framework:**  
   - Deploys deep learning models using **TensorFlow** for detecting anomalies with a focus on scalability and accuracy.  
   - Incorporates techniques like Autoencoders, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or other state-of-the-art models for pattern recognition in sequential data.  

4. **Evaluation and Insights:**  
   - Measures model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust anomaly detection.  
   - Visualizes detected anomalies against the original data for intuitive analysis.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow  
- **Deep Learning Techniques:** Autoencoders, LSTMs (or specific methods applied)  
- **Version Control:** Git
